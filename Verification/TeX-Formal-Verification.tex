\maketitle

A long time has passed since \TeX3 became public domain software, and thusly the \LaTeX\ format (informally a \textit{macro package}) became the dominant way for academia to typeset their papers in.\footnote{This is true of the STEM field only.}

There has been no attempts made to \textit{formally specify} and subsequently, \textit{verify} this typesetting engine. \ForTeX\ aims to fix this mistake.

This paper is released with the source for \ForTeX. These are the aforementioned specifications and verifications for my so-called formally-verified \TeX\ engine.
